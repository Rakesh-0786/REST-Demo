/*
HTTP Request / Response
Communication between clients and servers is done by
 requests and responses: A client (a browser) sends an HTTP 
 request to the web. A web server receives the request. 
 The server runs an application to process the request.
  The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser.

what is app.use(express.urlencoded({exptended:true}))?

The line app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })) is used in an Express.js application to parse incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it does and the meaning of the extended option:

What it Does
app.use(): This method mounts middleware functions to the Express application. Middleware functions are executed sequentially when a request is received.
express.urlencoded(): This middleware function parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads, which are typically sent by HTML forms using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type.
The extended Option
extended: true: This option allows the parsing of nested objects, using the qs library (a more powerful query string parsing library). With extended: true, the URL-encoded data can represent richer objects and arrays.
extended: false: This option uses the querystring library to parse URL-encoded data, which does not support nested objects.
