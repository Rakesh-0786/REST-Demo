/*REST: Rest Stands for Representational State Tranfer.
it's an architectural style or paradigm for distributed hypermedia systems.
It's just a set of guidelines, some ideas, some priciples for how clients and server can communicate with one another.
It is also called the RESTfull.

REST is an "architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems." Yikes.

Hypermedia: hypermedia refers to a system of interlinked multimedia content,
including text, images ,videos and other media types that allows users to navigate through
information in a non-linear manner.
It's an extension of hypertext, which specifically 
refers to text with hyperlinks.

In the context of web development and REST (Representational State Transfer):

Hypermedia Systems: These systems use hypermedia as the engine of application state. This means that the client interacts with the application entirely through hyperlinks provided by the server, which guide the client on how to proceed next.
RESTful APIs: REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. A key principle of REST is that a client should be able to interact with the application through hypermedia provided dynamically by the server. This is known as HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State).

It's basically a set of guidelines for how a client + server should communicate and 
perform CRUD operations on a given resource.

Gist:A gist is a feature provided by GitHub that allows you to easily share pieces of code, notes, or other text-based content. Gists are often used to share small scripts, configuration files, or documentation snippets with others.

The main idea of REST is treating data on the server-side as resources
than can be CRUDed

the most common way of approaching REST is in formatting the URL,s and HTTP verbs in your applications.

So how can i go about implementing different routes to allow a user to perform CRUD on that resource?
And the term resource comes up a lot in RESTful applications or in REST.

the Guy named ROY fielding who came up with this concept of REST.

Remember , REST is a set of principles that we follow when architecting a web application.
it is set of rules for clients -server communication .
